Subject: RE: Outdoor TV Enclosure Manufacturing Inquiry - Design Files + NDA

Hi Ted,

Thank you for the quick response - great to hear you can do watertight aluminum enclosures. That's exactly what we need.

I've attached:
1. **Design NDA** - Simple one-page agreement focused on protecting the design IP. If this works for you, please sign and return.

2. **ATE-75 Design Pack** (PDF) - Comprehensive technical package including:
   - External and internal dimensions
   - Materials specification (5052-H32 aluminum)
   - Thermal system (3x Delta 140mm fans)
   - Wiring and control logic
   - Exploded component breakdown
   - Full BOM (materials only, no pricing)

This should give you enough to assess feasibility and provide a ballpark quote. We're currently finalizing production CAD with a manufacturer here in Dubai - once that's complete, we can send you the full DXF/manufacturing drawings.

**Quantities:** Please quote for:
- 50 units
- 100 units
- 150 units

The 75" model (ATE-75) is the priority. If this goes well, we'd expand to 55", 65", and 85" models.

Happy to jump on a call if you have questions after reviewing the design pack.

Best regards,
Richard Foulkes
