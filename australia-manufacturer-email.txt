Hello,

I'm reaching out regarding a custom aluminum enclosure manufacturing project. We're developing premium outdoor TV enclosures for the Australian residential and commercial market.

- IP55 weatherproof rating
- Internal fan mounting, cable management, service door with gaskets
- VESA mounting system
- Estimated volume: 50-150 units/year initially

What We're Looking For:
- Full service: laser cutting, forming, welding, powder coating (in-house or managed)
- ISO 9001 certification preferred
- Experience with enclosures or outdoor equipment
- Prototype capability
- Lead time 2-4 weeks for production orders
