## 12. The Spirit of This Partnership

We're building this together. Richard built the product, systems, and IP. Tom will build the sales and customer base in the Middle East. Neither succeeds without the other.

50/50 in the ME operating company means equal say in operations and equal share of ME profits. The holding company structure protects the global IP while giving Tom full partnership in the regional business.

The buy-sell provisions ensure that if anything happens to either of us, the business can continue and families are treated fairly.
