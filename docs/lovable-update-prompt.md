# Lovable Update Prompt - Add Differentiation

## Context
The current landing page is well-designed but too generic. It could sell any outdoor TV enclosure. We need to add specific differentiators that position Apex as the premium choice with verifiable technical advantages.

## ADD: "Why Apex?" Comparison Section

After the trust bar or benefits section, add a visual comparison table:

### Design:
- Clean table with 3 columns: Feature | Typical Enclosures | Apex
- Use checkmarks (green) and X marks (red/grey)
- Subtle background highlighting on Apex column

### Content:

| Feature | Typical Enclosures | Apex ATE-75 |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Airflow | 80 CFM | 200+ CFM |
| Noise Level | 45+ dBA (always on) | ≤30 dBA (whisper quiet) |
| Fan Control | On/Off thermostat | PWM intelligent speed |
| Salt Spray Rating | 500-1000 hours | 2000+ hours |
| Warranty | 1 year | 5 years |
| Color Options | Black only | 200+ RAL colors |

---

## ADD: "Whisper-Quiet Operation" Feature Block

### Headline:
"The Quietest Outdoor Enclosure. Guaranteed."

### Copy:
"Most enclosures blast fans at full speed the moment it gets warm. Apex uses intelligent PWM control — fans spin only as fast as needed. At idle, you'll measure just 30 decibels. That's quieter than a library. Your poolside conversation won't compete with a wind tunnel."

### Visual Element:
Sound level comparison graphic:
- Whisper: 30 dB (Apex idle)
- Library: 40 dB
- Normal conversation: 60 dB
- Competitor enclosures: 45-50 dB (constant)

Use a horizontal bar chart or visual meter showing Apex at the quiet end.

## ADD: "Engineered for Gulf Climate" Feature Block

### Headline:
"Built for 55°C. Not Adapted for It."

### Copy:
"Other enclosures are designed for mild climates and 'work' in the Gulf. Apex was engineered specifically for extreme heat from day one. 200+ CFM of airflow handles 550 watts of heat dissipation. Salt-spray tested for 2,000+ hours — double the industry standard. This isn't a temperate-climate product with a bigger fan. It's Gulf-native engineering."

### Visual:
- Temperature gauge showing 55°C rating
- Or map highlighting Gulf region with "Designed Here" callout

---

## ADD: "Premium Finish Options" Section

### Headline:
"Match Your Space. Not Just Black."

### Copy:
"Standard enclosures come in black. Period. Apex offers over 200 RAL colors to match your villa's architecture, poolside furniture, or landscape design. Standard finishes ship immediately. Custom colors in 2-3 weeks."

### Visual:
Color swatch strip showing:
- Jet Black (RAL 9005) — Standard
- Pebble Grey (RAL 7032) — Standard
- Premium Colors — +$75
- Custom RAL — +$150

Show 4-5 lifestyle mockups of same enclosure in different colors/settings.

## ADD: "European Manufacturing Standards" Trust Block

### Location:
Near the bottom, before final CTA (builds credibility before purchase decision)

### Headline:
"Manufactured to European Standards"

### Copy:
"Apex enclosures are built by Eurotech Metal Industries — an ISO 9001/14001/45001 certified facility that supplies precision components to Schneider Electric. Every unit passes the same quality standards used for industrial electrical enclosures. AAMA 2604 powder coating. 2,000+ hour salt spray testing. This is industrial-grade protection for your entertainment investment."

### Visual:
- ISO certification badges
- "Schneider Electric Approved Supplier" mention
- Salt spray test icon with "2000+ hours"

---

## ADD: "5-Year Warranty" Highlight

### Current state:
The warranty is mentioned but not emphasized as a differentiator.

### Update:
Create a callout box near pricing:

"**5-Year Warranty** — While others offer 12 months, we stand behind our engineering for 5 full years. That's confidence you can measure."

---

## UPDATE: Hero Section

### Current headline is good, but add subtext:
After the main headline, add a smaller tagline:

"The only outdoor enclosure engineered specifically for Gulf climate. Whisper-quiet. 5-year warranty."

---

## STYLE NOTES

- Keep the premium, minimal aesthetic already established
- Use the navy/gold color scheme for new sections
- New comparison table should feel native, not bolted-on
- Sound level visualization should be simple — not a complex infographic
- Color swatches should look premium (think paint company websites, not cheap options)

---

## DO NOT

- Add testimonials we don't have
- Change the core page structure
- Add more CTAs (keep focused on single conversion goal)
- Make it feel cluttered — whitespace is premium
- Use superlatives without backing data ("best", "revolutionary")
