# Upwork Job Posting: Sheet Metal CAD Designer

## Title
Sheet Metal Enclosure - Convert Detailed Specs to Production CAD (SolidWorks/STEP)

---

## Description

I need a sheet metal CAD specialist to create production-ready 3D CAD files for an outdoor TV enclosure.

**Important: The engineering is 100% complete.** I have:
- Full specification document with all dimensions
- SVG technical drawings (cross-sections, front view, details)
- Complete bill of materials with specific components
- Thermal design validated
- This is NOT a design project - it's a CAD conversion/drafting job

**What I need you to create:**
1. SolidWorks assembly (.sldasm) with all parts
2. Individual part files (.sldprt) for each sheet metal component
3. STEP files for universal compatibility
4. DXF flat patterns for laser/CNC cutting
5. PDF engineering drawings with dimensions and tolerances

**Key Specifications (75" TV Enclosure):**
- External: 1760 × 1120 × 160mm
- Material: 2.0-2.5mm 5052-H32 aluminum sheet
- Bezel: 80mm top/bottom, 40mm sides
- Features: Hinged service door (4 latches), ventilation slots, fan mounting holes, VESA mounting plate, glass retention channel
- IP55 rated (gasket channels required)

**Deliverables:**
- Production-ready CAD files (not concept models)
- Files must be suitable for sheet metal fabrication (proper bend radii, K-factors)
- All components as separate parts in assembly
- Flat patterns for each sheet metal part

**I will provide:**
- 14-page design pack PDF with all specs
- SVG technical drawings
- BOM with all components and dimensions
- Direct communication to answer any questions

**Budget:** $400-800 USD (fixed price)
**Timeline:** 7-10 days

Please reply with:
1. Examples of similar sheet metal enclosure work
2. Your CAD software (SolidWorks preferred)
3. Estimated timeline
4. Any questions about the project
