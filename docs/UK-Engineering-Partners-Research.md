# UK Engineering Partners Research - Apex TV Enclosures

## The Gap (from Eurotech)
> "Topics such as ventilation, thermal management, and heat dissipation require a very specific level of expertise. These are critical points for the success of the product... we do not believe we would be able to fully deliver the level of engineering needed."

**What we need:** A UK company that can take our v5.3.0 spec and deliver a complete, manufacturing-ready design package (electronics layout + thermal engineering + mechanical CAD/DXF) to hand to Eurotech.

## DRAFT ENQUIRY EMAIL

```
Subject: Outdoor Electronics Enclosure - Full Engineering Design Package Required

Dear [Company],

We're developing the Apex TV Enclosure, an IP55-rated outdoor enclosure
for consumer TVs, designed for the Gulf climate (55°C ambient + solar load).

Our manufacturing partner (UAE-based metal fabricator) requires a complete
engineering design package before they can produce prototypes:

What we have:
- Detailed product specification (v5.3.0)
- Component BOM (Delta fans, MERV 8 filters, PWM controller concept)
- Target thermal performance (165-195 CFM, 550W heat dissipation)
- Basic layout concept and airflow strategy

What we need:
- Electronics layout with placement coordinates
- Thermal validation (CFD or equivalent)
- Complete mechanical CAD (ideally STEP + DXF for sheet metal)
- Manufacturing-ready documentation

Key challenges:
- Active cooling with 3× 140mm Delta fans
- IP55 protection with front-breathing ventilation
- 55°C ambient + solar gain thermal management
- Noise targets (≤34 dBA at normal operation)

Could we arrange a brief call to discuss whether this project fits
your capabilities and get a rough indication of timeline/budget?

Best regards,
[Name]
Apex Enclosures
```
