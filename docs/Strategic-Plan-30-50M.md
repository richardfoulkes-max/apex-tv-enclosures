## Valuation Math

| Business Unit | Year 2 Revenue | Multiple | Valuation |
|---------------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Apex Enclosures (GCC) | $3M | 2.5x | $7.5M |
| Apex Enclosures (US) | $2M | 2.5x | $5M |
| Apex Enclosures (AU) | $1M | 2.5x | $2.5M |
| Pool Equipment (GCC) | $1.5M | 2.5x | $3.75M |
| Model Marketplace | $1.5M (on $15M GMV) | 8x | $12M |
| **TOTAL** | **$9M** | | **$30.75M** |

**Aggressive scenario (+$20M):**
- US traction faster: +$3M revenue = +$7.5M valuation
- Marketplace GMV $25M: +$1M revenue at 10x = +$10M valuation
- Strategic premium from acquirer interest: +$5M

## The Portfolio

### 1. Apex TV Enclosures
**The cash engine** - generates revenue and proves business model

| Market | Year 1 Target | Year 2 Target | Key Partner |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| GCC (UAE, Saudi) | $800K | $3M | Eurotech (mfg), Tom Brooks (sales) |
| US | $200K | $2M | Scott (sales), TBD (mfg) |
| Australia | $150K | $1M | Nick Dempsey (sales + mfg) |

**Unit economics:**
- ASP: $2,500 USD (weighted average across sizes)
- COGS: $900 (manufacturing + shipping)
- Gross margin: 64%
- Customer acquisition: $200-400/customer
- LTV:CAC ratio: 4-6x (good)

### 2. Pool Equipment Enclosures (APE Series)
**The upsell** - same customer, same manufacturer, incremental revenue

| Product | ASP | Year 1 Units | Year 2 Units |
|---------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| APE-P (Pump) | $800 | 100 | 400 |
| APE-HC (Heater/Chiller) | $1,000 | 50 | 200 |
| APE-S (Storage) | $600 | 80 | 300 |
| **Bundles** | $2,000 | 30 | 150 |

**Year 2 revenue:** ~$1.5M

### 3. Model Marketplace (ModelDirect)
**The multiplier** - tech platform with higher valuation multiple

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| GMV | $3M | $15M |
| Take rate | 12% | 10% |
| Revenue | $360K | $1.5M |
| Bookings/month | 300 | 1,500 |
| Average booking | $800 | $830 |

**Why this matters:**
- Enclosures at 2.5x multiple = need $20M revenue for $50M valuation
- Marketplace at 8-10x multiple = need $5M revenue for $50M valuation
- Marketplace is the valuation accelerator

## Key Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Path Items

3. **Marketplace MVP** - needs to launch by Q2 2026 to matter for valuation

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Prototype delayed | High | Medium | Have backup manufacturer (KDM China) |
| US tariffs increase | Medium | Low | US manufacturing solves this |
| Marketplace doesn't get traction | High | Medium | Enclosures still profitable standalone |
| Competitor copies product | Medium | Medium | Speed to market, brand, service |
| Partner doesn't perform | High | Low | Clear milestones, equity vesting |
| Cash flow crunch | High | Medium | Pre-orders, deposits, inventory management |

## The Model Marketplace Opportunity

This deserves special attention because it's your valuation multiplier.

### Why Model Marketplace?
1. **Personal connection** - Anna's experience gives authentic insight
2. **Broken market** - hidden fees, no transparency, ripe for disruption
3. **Tech multiples** - 8-15x vs 2-3x for products
4. **Lower capital intensity** - no inventory, no manufacturing
5. **Network effects** - more models = more clients = more models

### Competitive Advantage
| Competitor | Weakness | ModelDirect Advantage |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| Traditional agencies | 40-60% hidden fees | Transparent 10-15% fee |
| StarNow/Mandy | Freelance chaos, no quality control | Curated, verified talent |
| Instagram DMs | No payment protection, no contracts | Escrow, contracts, insurance |

### MVP Feature Set (Q2 2026)
1. Model profiles with verified portfolios
2. Client search and booking requests
3. Transparent pricing (model sets rate)
4. Platform fee clearly shown
5. Escrow payment (release on job completion)
6. Basic messaging
7. Cancellation protection

### Growth Strategy
- **Phase 1:** UK market, fashion/commercial models
- **Phase 2:** Add photographers, stylists, MUAs
- **Phase 3:** US expansion (LA, NYC, Miami)
- **Phase 4:** Events, influencer bookings

## Summary

**The formula:**
```
$30-50M = Enclosures ($15M) + Pool ($4M) + Marketplace ($12-20M)
                ↓                  ↓              ↓
           Cash flow         Upsell         Valuation multiplier
```

**What makes this achievable:**
1. Enclosures are nearly ready - just need prototype
2. Three regional partners already identified
3. Pool equipment uses same manufacturer, same customers
4. Marketplace solves a real problem you understand personally
5. 24 months is enough time if you start now

**What could derail it:**
1. Prototype delays beyond Q1 2026
2. Spreading too thin across too many things
3. Marketplace never gets traction (but enclosures still work)
4. Partner underperformance
5. Running out of cash before revenue ramps

**The honest odds:**
- $30M valuation: 40% probability (ambitious but achievable)
- $50M valuation: 15% probability (requires marketplace success)
- $10-20M valuation: 60% probability (most likely outcome)
- Failure (<$5M): 20% probability (prototype fails, no sales)
