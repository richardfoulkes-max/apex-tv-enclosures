## DESIGN DIRECTION

**Vibe:** Premium, minimal, confident. Think Bang & Olufsen meets outdoor living. NOT cheap/discount. NOT cluttered tech specs.

**Color palette:**
- Primary: Deep Navy (#1a1a2e)
- Accent: Warm Gold (#d4a574)
- CTA: Vibrant Orange (#e85d04)
- Background: Clean white/off-white
- Text: Charcoal (#2d2d2d)

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Bold sans-serif (Inter, Montserrat)
- Body: Clean sans-serif
- Large, confident text — not cramped

**Layout:**
- Mobile-first (70%+ of traffic is mobile)
- Generous whitespace
- Full-width sections with alternating backgrounds
- Sticky CTA button on mobile (bottom of screen)

**Images/Video - USE PLACEHOLDERS:**

We don't have final photography yet. Create styled placeholder boxes that show:

1. **Hero placeholder:** "LIFESTYLE IMAGE: Dubai villa poolside, evening, TV showing sports"
2. **Product placeholder:** "PRODUCT SHOT: Front 3/4 view of enclosure"
3. **Internal view placeholder:** "PRODUCT SHOT: Door open showing cooling system"
4. **Optional video placeholder:** "VIDEO: 30-sec product demo" (if design needs video)

Make placeholders look intentional (styled boxes with icon + description), not broken images. Use the navy/gold color scheme for placeholder backgrounds.

When we have assets, we'll drop them in. For now, the placeholders communicate what's needed.

## COPY GUIDELINES

**Headline formulas that work:**

**Key messages to weave in:**
1. Price anchoring: Always compare to $8,000+ outdoor TVs
2. Flexibility: Use ANY TV you want, upgrade anytime
3. Engineering: Built for Gulf climate specifically (55°C)
4. Risk reversal: $100 fully refundable, 5-year warranty

**Words to use:** Protect, engineered, Gulf climate, weatherproof, upgrade, premium
**Words to avoid:** Cheap, discount, deal, revolutionary, game-changer
