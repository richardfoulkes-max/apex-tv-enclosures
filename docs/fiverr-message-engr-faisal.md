Hi Faisal,

I need production-ready CAD for an outdoor TV enclosure. All engineering is complete - I just need someone to convert my detailed specs into manufacturing files.

**PROJECT SUMMARY:**
- 75" outdoor TV enclosure (wall-mounted, weatherproof)
- Dimensions: 1760 x 1120 x 160mm
- Material: 2.0-2.5mm 5052-H32 aluminum sheet metal
- IP55 rated (gasket channels required)

**MECHANICAL FEATURES:**
- Main enclosure body with 80mm top/bottom bezels
- Hinged service door (bottom) with 4 compression latches
- 12x ventilation slots in top and bottom bezels (recessed for IP55)
- Glass retention channel (6mm laminated glass)
- VESA mounting plate (600x400 pattern)
- Internal vertical rails for TV mounting
- Cable entry grommets (2x 30mm)

**THERMAL SYSTEM (simple):**
- 3x 140mm fan mounting cutouts (Delta AFB1412HH-A)
- Mounting point for small PWM controller box (~80x50x25mm)
- Filter drawer slot in bottom bezel

**WHAT I HAVE READY:**
- 14-page design pack PDF with all dimensions
- SVG technical cross-section drawings
- Complete BOM with specific components
- Control logic documentation
- STEP files for electrical components (fans, power supply, cable glands, inlet)

**WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:**
1. SolidWorks assembly (.sldasm) with all parts
2. Individual part files (.sldprt)
3. STEP files for universal compatibility
4. DXF flat patterns for laser/CNC cutting
5. 2D manufacturing drawings with dimensions and bend callouts

**QUESTIONS:**
1. Can you handle this full scope?
2. What's your price for a project this size?
3. What's your timeline?
4. Do you need anything else to provide a quote?

I can share the complete design pack immediately. This is CAD conversion work - all engineering decisions are made.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Richard
