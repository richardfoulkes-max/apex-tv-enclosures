- Assembly instructions
- Quality acceptance criteria

REQUEST:
1. Can you manufacture aluminum enclosures to IP55 specification?
2. Do you handle powder coating in-house or via subcontractor?
3. What is your prototype lead time and pricing?
4. What are your MOQ and volume pricing tiers?

We are ready to share full technical documentation upon confirmation of interest and NDA if required.

## 3. Post-Interest - Sending Full Technical Package

**Use for:** After manufacturer confirms interest, before or after NDA

**Subject:** `RE: [Original Subject] - Design Files`

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Thank you for your interest. [NDA reference if applicable]

I've attached:

1. ATE-75 Design Pack (PDF) - Comprehensive technical package with all dimensions, materials spec (5052-H32 aluminum), thermal system details, wiring diagrams, and full BOM.

Quantities for quote:
- 50 units
- 100 units
- 150 units

Quote for a prototype if we can as well.

Ideally we would want to manufacture as per customer requirements particularly around colour finishes rather than in bulk.

We are happy to jump on a call if you have questions after reviewing.

Best regards,
Richard
