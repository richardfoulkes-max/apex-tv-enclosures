# Apex US Company Setup Guide

**Status:** On hold until prototype confirmed
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-10

---

## Recommended Structure

- **Entity:** Delaware C-Corp via Stripe Atlas
- **Cost:** $500 setup + ~$325/year ongoing
- **Why Delaware:** Credibility with US manufacturers, investor-friendly, Stripe Atlas support

---

## Ownership Structure

| Party | Equity | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Richard | 100% shares | Full ownership |
| Scott | Options for 49% | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |
| Reserve | 1% | Future employees/advisors |

**Key:** Scott gets OPTIONS, not actual shares. Protects against death, divorce, departure.

---

## Tax Implications (Dubai Resident Owner)

### Federal (IRS)
- 21% corporate tax on profits
- Form 1120 annual return (required)
- Form 5472 foreign ownership disclosure ($25K penalty if missed)
- Salary to yourself: 0% US tax (non-resident wages)
- Dividends: 30% withholding (no US-UAE treaty)

### Delaware State
- Franchise tax: $225/year minimum
- State income tax: 0% (no operations in Delaware)
- Annual report: $50/year
- Due: March 1

### Strategy
Maximize salary (reduces corp profit, not taxed in US) → minimize dividends (avoid 30% withholding)

---

## Annual Compliance

| Date | Task | Cost |
|------|------|------|
| March 1 | Delaware Franchise Tax + Annual Report | ~$275 |
| April 15 | Form 1120 + 5472 | CPA: $500-1,500 |
| Quarterly | Estimated tax payments | 21% of profits |

**Total annual cost:** ~$1,500-3,000 (taxes + CPA + registered agent)

---

## Scott's Options Terms

```
Grant: Options for 490,000 shares (49%)
Vesting: 3 years
Cliff: 1 year (16.3% vests at 12 months)
Monthly vesting: Remaining 32.7% vests monthly over Years 2-3
Strike Price: $0.001/share
Exercise Cost: $490 total for full 49%
```

### Protections Built In
- Unvested options expire on departure
- 90-day exercise window on death
- Right of first refusal on any transfer

### Company Repurchase Right (KEY PROTECTION)

**If Scott leaves VOLUNTARILY before Year 4:**
- Company CAN (not must) buy back ALL vested shares
- Price: **Lower of FMV or original strike price**
- Window: 90 days from departure to exercise repurchase
- Scott must sell if company exercises this right

**What this means:**
- Scott vests 49% over 3 years (faster)
- But if he quits at Year 2, you can buy back his 32.6% for ~$326
- He only keeps shares "safely" after Year 4
- Protects you from someone vesting and bailing

**Repurchase right does NOT apply if:**
- Scott is terminated without cause (he keeps vested shares)
- Scott dies or becomes disabled (estate keeps vested shares)
- Company is sold (acceleration, he keeps everything)
- After Year 4 (fully earned, no clawback)

### Vesting Schedule

| Time | Vested | Repurchasable? |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 6 months | 0% | N/A |
| 1 year (cliff) | 16.3% | Yes, until Year 4 |
| 2 years | 32.6% | Yes, until Year 4 |
| 3 years | 49% | Yes, until Year 4 |
| **4 years** | 49% | **No - fully his** |

### If Richard Dies - Business Continuity

**Scott's rights are PROTECTED:**
1. Scott continues operating US business uninterrupted
2. Richard's heirs inherit Richard's shares but CANNOT:
   - Remove Scott as operator
   - Block day-to-day business decisions
   - Revoke Scott's vested options
   - Interfere with US territory operations
3. Heirs receive economic benefits only (dividends, eventual sale proceeds)
4. Scott has RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL to buy Richard's shares from estate at FMV
5. If heirs want to sell, Scott can match any third-party offer

**Built into Operating Agreement:**
- "Successor Passive Investor" clause - heirs get money, not control
- Scott retains full operational authority for US territory
- Major decisions require Scott's consent (heirs cannot override)
- Heirs can sell their shares but Scott has first right to buy

---

## Buy-Sell Agreement Terms

**Trigger Events:**
- Death
- Permanent disability
- Voluntary departure
- Termination for cause

**Buyback:**
- Automatic at Fair Market Value
- Valuation: Formula-based (e.g., 3x net profit)
- Payment: Within 90 days
- Funding: Key-person life insurance policy
