## Buy-Sell Agreement (CRITICAL)

### Trigger Events

| Event | Buyback Triggered |
|-------|-------------------|
| Death | Yes - automatic |
| Permanent disability | Yes - automatic |
| Voluntary exit | Yes - 90 days notice |
| Termination for cause | Yes - immediate |
| Bankruptcy | Yes - automatic |

### Buyback Terms

**On Death of Either Partner:**

```
1. Surviving partner MUST buy deceased's shares
2. Deceased's estate MUST sell (no option to keep)
3. Price: Fair Market Value (see valuation below)
4. Payment: Within 90 days of death
5. Funding: Key-person life insurance on both partners

Fair Market Value = Higher of:
  (a) 3x average net profit (last 3 years), OR
  (b) 1x revenue (last 12 months), OR
  (c) Book value of net assets

Minimum floor: Total capital contributed
```

- Cost shared equally
- Takes longer but more accurate

- Partners review and agree valuation annually
- Signed statement of agreed value
- Simplifies process if trigger event occurs
