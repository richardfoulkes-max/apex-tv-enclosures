## Cash Flow Considerations

### Payment Terms

| Transaction | Terms | Cash Flow Impact |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| Customer orders | 50% deposit, 50% on delivery | Positive - deposit funds production |
| AU manufacturer | 50% on order, 50% on completion | Neutral - customer deposit covers |
| China manufacturer | 30% deposit, 70% before shipping | Need ~$300/unit float for 4-6 weeks |
| US manufacturer | Net 30 typical | Need 30-day float |

### Working Capital Cycle

**Australian Manufacturing (Made-to-Order)**
```
Day 0: Customer pays 50% deposit ($1,100)
Day 1: Order placed with fabricator, pay 50% ($600)
Day 21: Unit complete, pay remaining 50% ($600)
Day 28: Deliver to customer, receive 50% balance ($1,100)

Net cash position: Always positive after deposit
```

**China Volume Orders (50+ units)**
```
Day 0: Pay 30% deposit ($13,500 for 50 units)
Day 45: Pay 70% before shipping ($31,500)
Day 60: Units arrive in AU
Day 75: Sell to retailers, collect payment

Cash required: ~$45,000 float for 75 days
```

## Tax Considerations

### US C-Corp (Non-Resident Owner)

| Item | Rate | Strategy |
|------|------|----------|
| Corporate tax | 21% | Unavoidable on US profits |
| Dividend withholding | 30% | **Avoid** - no US-UAE treaty |
| Management fees | 0% | **Use this** - deductible to corp, tax-free in UAE |

**Optimal structure:** Pay yourself management fees, not dividends. Corp deducts fees, you receive in UAE tax-free.

### Australia (If Pty Ltd)

| Item | Rate | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Company tax | 25% | Small business rate |
| GST | 10% | Collected from customers, remitted quarterly |
| Dividend franking | N/A | Franking credits for AU residents only |

**For non-AU residents:** Similar to US - management fees preferred over dividends.

## Risk Mitigation

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Slow initial sales | Made-to-order model = no inventory risk |
| Currency fluctuation | Price in local currency, adjust quarterly |
| Bad debt | 50% deposit required, balance before delivery |
| Manufacturing defects | QC checklist, 5% contingency in pricing |

### Insurance Requirements

| Coverage | Est. Cost | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Product Liability (US) | $1,000-2,000/yr | Required, $1M minimum |
| Product Liability (AU) | $1,500-3,000 AUD/yr | Required for retail |
| General Liability | Often bundled | Slip/fall at demo etc. |
