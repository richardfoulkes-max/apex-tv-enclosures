# Apex Enclosures - Financial Planning Guide

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the capital requirements for launching Apex Enclosures in the US and Australian markets. Total investment ranges from **$6,500 (minimal)** to **$54,000 (fully operational in both markets)**.

### Key Structure Decision: Different Models for Different Markets

| Market | Your Role | Invoice From | Your Tax Rate |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Australia** | Supplier to Nick | UAE (personal/company) | **0%** |
| **US** | Owner of US entity | US C-Corp | **21%** |

**Why different?**
- **Australia:** Nick has existing business. You're just a supplier. Invoice from UAE = 0% tax.
- **US:** Need local entity for credibility, banking, Scott's options. C-Corp required = 21% tax.

---

## US Market Budget

### Entity Structure
- **Entity Type:** Delaware C-Corp (via Stripe Atlas)
- **Why C-Corp:** Only option for non-US residents (S-Corp requires US persons)
- **Tax Strategy:** Management fees (not dividends) to avoid 30% withholding

## Australia Market Budget

### Entity Structure: Supplier Model (Invoice from UAE)

**Nick has existing Australian business** - you are simply his supplier.

**Structure:**
```
You (UAE)                     Nick (AU Business)
    │                              │
    │  Invoice wholesale           │
    │  from UAE (0% tax)           │
    ├─────────────────────────────►│
    │                              │
    │  Nick sells retail           │
    │  (25% AU company tax)        │
    │                              ▼
    │                         AU Customer
```

**Key Points:**
- You invoice Nick from UAE = **0% tax** on your margin
- Nick handles AU sales, GST, insurance, compliance
- No AU entity needed for you
- No US C-Corp involvement (that's only for US sales)
- Simple supplier/distributor agreement

**Your costs: $0 for entity setup**

### Tax Comparison: Why UAE (Not US C-Corp)

| Route | Your Tax on AU Profits |
|-------|------------------------|
| Invoice from UAE | **0%** |
| Invoice from US C-Corp | **21%** |

**Example (75" unit):**
- Your wholesale price to Nick: $1,400
- Your cost (China landed): $900
- Your margin: $500

Via UAE: $500 × 0% = **$500 net profit**
Via US: $500 × 21% = **$395 net profit**

**26% more profit by invoicing from UAE.**

### Setup Costs (One-Time)

| Item | Cost (AUD) | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| AU Entity Setup | $0 | Nick's existing business |
| Partnership Agreement (legal) | $500-1,000 | Optional but recommended |
| Domain/Website (AU-specific) | $500-1,000 | .com.au domain, AU content |
| **Total Setup** | **$500-2,000** | ~$350-1,300 USD |

### Annual Operating Costs (Your Share)

| Item | Cost/Year (AUD) | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| ASIC / Accounting | $0 | Nick's responsibility |
| Product Liability Insurance | $0 | Nick covers as reseller |
| Marketing contribution | $1,000-3,000 | Split with Nick |
| **Total Annual** | **$1,000-3,000** | ~$650-2,000 USD |

### Working Capital (To Launch Sales)

| Item | Cost (AUD) | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Prototype with AU fabricator | $2,000-3,000 | First article for quality approval |
| First production run (10 units) | $12,000-15,000 | ~$1,200 per unit AU manufacturing |
| Marketing (initial) | $2,000-5,000 | Google Ads, industry directories |
| Demo unit for Nick | $1,500-2,000 | Sales tool - essential |
| **Total Working Capital** | **$17,500-25,000** | ~$11,700-16,700 USD |

### Australia Investment Summary

| Scenario | Investment (AUD) | Investment (USD) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Minimal** | $1,500-5,000 | $1,000-3,300 |
| **Ready to Sell** | $19,000-30,000 | $12,700-20,000 |

*Significantly lower with Nick's existing business handling entity/compliance*

## Cash Flow Considerations

### Payment Terms

| Transaction | Terms | Cash Flow Impact |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| Customer orders | 50% deposit, 50% on delivery | Positive - deposit funds production |
| AU manufacturer | 50% on order, 50% on completion | Neutral - customer deposit covers |
| China manufacturer | 30% deposit, 70% before shipping | Need ~$300/unit float for 4-6 weeks |
| US manufacturer | Net 30 typical | Need 30-day float |

### Working Capital Cycle

**Australian Manufacturing (Made-to-Order)**
```
Day 0: Customer pays 50% deposit ($1,100)
Day 1: Order placed with fabricator, pay 50% ($600)
Day 21: Unit complete, pay remaining 50% ($600)
Day 28: Deliver to customer, receive 50% balance ($1,100)

Net cash position: Always positive after deposit
```

**China Volume Orders (50+ units)**
```
Day 0: Pay 30% deposit ($13,500 for 50 units)
Day 45: Pay 70% before shipping ($31,500)
Day 60: Units arrive in AU
Day 75: Sell to retailers, collect payment

Cash required: ~$45,000 float for 75 days
```

## Tax Considerations

### Global Structure Overview

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   YOU (UAE)     │
                    │   0% tax base   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
            ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
            │                │                │
            ▼                ▼                ▼
    ┌───────────────┐ ┌───────────────┐ ┌───────────────┐
    │  US C-Corp    │ │  Nick (AU)    │ │  Tom (ME)     │
    │  21% corp tax │ │  You=Supplier │ │  50/50 JV     │
    │  Scott=Options│ │  0% your tax  │ │  5% IP fee    │
    └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘ └───────────────┘
```

### US C-Corp (For US Sales Only)

| Item | Rate | Strategy |
|------|------|----------|
| Corporate tax | 21% | Unavoidable on US profits |
| Dividend withholding | 30% | **Avoid** - no US-UAE treaty |
| Management fees | 0% | **Use this** - deductible to corp, tax-free in UAE |

**Optimal structure:** Pay yourself management fees, not dividends. Corp deducts fees, you receive in UAE tax-free.

**When to use US C-Corp:**
- US customer sales (need US presence)
- Scott's equity (options in US entity)
- US manufacturer payments
- US bank account for US operations

### Australia (Supplier Model - No AU Entity)

| Item | Rate | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Your tax on AU profits | **0%** | Invoice from UAE |
| Nick's company tax | 25% | His problem, not yours |
| GST | 10% | Nick handles |
| Withholding on payments to you | **0%** | No AU-UAE withholding on services |

**Optimal structure:** You are Nick's supplier. Invoice from UAE. Receive payment in UAE. 0% tax.

**Do NOT route AU profits through US C-Corp** - adds unnecessary 21% tax.

### Tax Summary by Market

| Market | Entity | Your Tax | How to Extract Profits |
|--------|--------|----------|------------------------|
| **US** | C-Corp | 21% | Management fees (0% withholding) |
| **Australia** | None (supplier) | 0% | Invoice from UAE |
| **Middle East** | 50/50 JV | 0%* | Profit share + 5% IP license |

*UAE/GCC has 0% personal income tax

## Risk Mitigation

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Slow initial sales | Made-to-order model = no inventory risk |
| Currency fluctuation | Price in local currency, adjust quarterly |
| Bad debt | 50% deposit required, balance before delivery |
| Manufacturing defects | QC checklist, 5% contingency in pricing |

### Insurance Requirements

| Coverage | Est. Cost | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Product Liability (US) | $1,000-2,000/yr | Required, $1M minimum |
| Product Liability (AU) | $1,500-3,000 AUD/yr | Required for retail |
| General Liability | Often bundled | Slip/fall at demo etc. |

---

## Funding Options

### Self-Funded (Recommended for Phase 1)
- Maintain 100% control
- No investor complications
- Prove model before raising

### Partner Structures (Not All Are Equity)

| Partner | Market | Relationship | Equity? |
|---------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Scott** | US | Options for 49% in US C-Corp | Yes (vesting) |
| **Nick** | Australia | Distributor - buys wholesale from you | No (customer) |
| **Tom** | Middle East | 50/50 JV partner | Yes (50%) |

**Nick is NOT an equity partner** - he's a customer/distributor. He buys at wholesale, sells at retail, keeps his margin. You keep your margin. No shared ownership, no complicated accounting.

### What You Own vs What Nick Owns (Australia)

| Asset | You Own | Nick Owns |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Product IP / Design** | ✅ 100% | ❌ |
| **Brand "Apex Enclosures"** | ✅ 100% | ❌ |
| **Manufacturing relationships** | ✅ (China, UAE) | ✅ (AU fabricator, if he sets it up) |
| **Customer list (AU)** | ✅ Copy rights | ✅ His customers |
| **Inventory (once paid for)** | ❌ | ✅ His stock |
| **His company** | ❌ | ✅ 100% |
| **AU distributor rights** | ✅ You grant these | License only |
| **Profits from his sales** | ❌ His margin | ✅ His margin |
| **Profits from wholesale** | ✅ Your margin | ❌ |

**Clear separation:**
- **You own:** IP, brand, product design, global rights
- **Nick owns:** His company, his customer relationships, his margin
- **Nick licenses:** Right to sell Apex products in Australia (revocable)

**If relationship ends:**
- You keep: All IP, brand, design, right to appoint new AU distributor
- Nick keeps: His company, customer goodwill he built, unsold inventory (he paid for it)
- Nick loses: Right to sell Apex products, use of brand

**This is NOT a partnership.** It's a supplier-distributor relationship. Like how a car dealer doesn't "own" Toyota - they just have rights to sell Toyotas in their territory.

### Protecting Yourself in Distributor Model (Nick)

**Risks with distributor-only relationship:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Nick finds another supplier | Exclusive agreement with minimum commitments |
| Nick copies the product | Design patent ($1.5-3K), trade dress over time |
| Nick doesn't push sales | Minimum order quantities, exclusivity tied to performance |
| Nick damages the brand | Brand guidelines, quality requirements, termination rights |
| Nick doesn't pay | Prepayment or short credit terms (Net 14) |
| Nick poaches your other markets | Territory restriction (Australia only) |

**Key Terms for Distributor Agreement:**

1. **Exclusivity (conditional):**
   - Nick gets exclusive AU rights IF he hits minimums
   - Minimums: e.g., 50 units Year 1, 100 units Year 2
   - Miss minimums = loses exclusivity (you can add other AU distributors)

2. **Territory restriction:**
   - Nick can only sell in Australia
   - Cannot sell to US, ME, or other markets
   - Cannot sell online outside Australia

3. **Payment terms:**
   - Prepayment for first 3 orders
   - Then Net 14 after relationship established
   - Credit limit based on track record

4. **IP protection:**
   - Nick cannot manufacture competing products
   - Cannot reverse-engineer or share specs
   - Must use your branding, cannot rebrand
   - Design patent protects you globally

5. **Termination:**
   - Either party can exit with 90 days notice
   - Immediate termination for payment default
   - You keep all IP, customer data, brand

6. **Non-compete (if he exits):**
   - 12-24 month non-compete on similar products
   - Protects against him copying and competing

**Bottom line:** You're protected by:
- Written distributor agreement (not handshake)
- Design patent (file before sharing detailed specs)
- Performance-based exclusivity
- Short payment terms
- Termination rights

**Cost to protect yourself:** ~$2,000-4,000
- Distributor agreement (lawyer): $500-1,000
- Design patent: $1,500-3,000

### External Funding (Future)
- Only consider after proving unit economics
- C-Corp structure is investor-ready
- QSBS qualification starts from incorporation date
