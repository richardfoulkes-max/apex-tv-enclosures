**Subject:** RE: RFQ - Custom Outdoor TV Enclosure (75") - Full Technical Package

Dear Danica,

Thank you for your quick response and interest in this project.

**Regarding IP66:** We do **not** require third-party certification. We need the enclosure **built to IP66 design standards**, meaning:

- Dust tight construction with continuous EPDM gasket sealing
- Protected against powerful water jets - proper drainage, no exposed gaps
- IP66-rated cable glands and labyrinth ventilation design

We provide the sealing design in our drawings. You manufacture and assemble to spec. No certification paperwork required.

**Attached: Complete Technical Package**

Please find attached all documentation needed to quote this project:

1. **Apex-Specification.pdf** - Full technical specification with drawings
2. **Apex-BOM.pdf** - Bill of materials (reference - you may source alternatives)
3. **Apex-Wiring.pdf** - Electrical wiring diagram
4. **Apex-Control-Logic.pdf** - Fan control system requirements
5. **Apex-QC-Checklist.pdf** - Quality control checkpoints

**Project Scope - What We Need Built:**

| Component | Our Input | Your Responsibility |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Aluminum enclosure | Full drawings with tolerances | Fabricate, powder coat, assemble |
| Glass front panel | Specifications | Source and install |
| Gaskets & seals | IP66 spec provided | Source EPDM gaskets, cable glands |
| Door hardware | Spec (hinges, latches, locks) | Source and install |
| Fan system | Performance spec in docs | **Propose solution and source** |
| Control system | Performance spec in docs | **Propose solution and source** |
| Power distribution | Wiring diagram provided | Assemble |

---

**Fan Control - Key Requirements:**

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Start temperature | 30°C internal air temp |
| Fan speed at 30°C | 20% PWM (near silent) |
| Fan speed at 45°C | 100% PWM (full cooling) |
| Ramp behavior | Linear/smooth (no sudden jumps) |
| Failsafe | 100% speed if sensor fails OR temp >50°C |

**Note:** Lower temperature thresholds protect consumer TVs (rated 0-35°C operating).

**You propose** the controller module and fan models. We will approve or provide feedback.

**Please Provide:**

1. **Quotation** for 1 prototype unit (75" size as per drawings)
2. **Lead time** for prototype
3. **Unit pricing** at 10 / 50 / 100 quantity
4. **Your proposed solution** for fan control system
5. Confirmation of **powder coating** capability (matte white or sand)

---

**Questions:**

1. Can you deliver a complete unit (enclosure + electronics + fans assembled and tested)?

2. Do you have experience with temperature-controlled fan systems, or would you work with an electronics partner?

3. Are you open to a **factory visit** so we can discuss in person?

I am available for a call or WhatsApp video anytime to walk through the requirements.
