Dear Danica,

Thank you for your prompt response and for reviewing the technical package.

Regarding the company documents: we are currently in the product development phase and would like to validate the prototype before establishing the formal entity. This is standard practice for us when entering a new product category.

For the prototype stage, I am happy to proceed as an individual buyer and settle payment in advance. Once we have validated the design and confirmed production viability, we will establish the trading company and provide all required documentation for ongoing orders.

Would this arrangement work for the initial prototype quotation?

I am available to discuss further by phone or WhatsApp at your convenience.

Best regards,

Richard
