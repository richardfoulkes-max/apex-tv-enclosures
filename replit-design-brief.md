### Current Brand Colors (open to change)
- Primary: Teal (#0d9488) - used on current internal site
- We're open to Replit suggesting a fresh palette

### Visual Style Preferences
- **Modern, premium, clean** - think Apple, Bang & Olufsen

- Lifestyle mockups

### Image Assets We Need Help With

- Lifestyle scenes

---

## 8. Technical Requirements

2. **Trust in 30 seconds:** "These guys know what they're doing, it's engineered properly"
3. **Take action in 60 seconds:** Click WhatsApp or submit quote form

### Primary Conversion Goal

---

## 10. Timeline & Scope

### For v1 Launch
- Homepage
- Product page(s)
- FAQ
- Contact/Quote page
- Mobile responsive
- WhatsApp integration

### Future (v2)
- Partner portal (trade pricing)
- Customer gallery
- Blog/content
- Arabic translation
- Online ordering
- **Fin AI chatbot** (see below)

### Future Add-On: Fin AI (fin.ai)

We're considering Fin AI by Intercom for automated customer support. Not required for v1, but worth designing with this in mind.

**What it does:**
- AI-powered chat that answers customer questions automatically
- Trained on our FAQ, specs, and policies
- Escalates complex queries to WhatsApp/human
- Works across chat widget, WhatsApp, SMS

**Pricing:** $0.99 per resolved conversation (pay only when AI fully handles it)

**Integration:** Simple JavaScript snippet - can be added later without redesign:
```html
<script>
  window.intercomSettings = { app_id: "YOUR_APP_ID" };
</script>
<script src="https://widget.intercom.io/widget/YOUR_APP_ID"></script>
```

**Design consideration:** If we add Fin later, it replaces/augments the WhatsApp floating button with a chat widget. No major redesign needed - just keep the bottom-right corner flexible for either WhatsApp button OR Fin chat bubble.

## 12. Open Questions for Replit

1. **Color palette:** Should we stick with teal or try something new? What feels premium but not cold?

2. **Hero approach:** Lifestyle photo vs. product-focused vs. video background?

3. **Product pages:** One page per size or single page with size selector?

4. **Pricing display:** Show prices prominently or "Get Quote" approach?

## 14. Competitor Analysis & Required Improvements

We analyzed the top-performing websites in this category. Here's what market leaders do that we need to incorporate:

### Competitor Benchmarks

**The Display Shield** (Market leader, $59M revenue):
- "47,500 locations in 58 countries" social proof
- 7-year warranty + 30-day money-back guarantee prominently displayed
- BBB A+ rating badge
- Customer testimonial carousel with specific quotes
- 5 product tiers with detailed comparison charts
- 12 industry-specific landing pages
- Media mentions (Bar Rescue, Animal Planet)

**SunBrite TV** (Premium segment):
- "Full Shade" vs "Full Sun" segmentation - guides customer decisions
- Professional photo gallery (residential + commercial)
- Free shipping banner repeated throughout
- Side-by-side product comparison tools

**Aqualite Outdoor** (UK/similar market):
- Named enterprise clients (Heathrow Airport, Alton Towers)
- "Daily Mail Top Rated" media badge
- Case studies with specific results
- WhatsApp floating widget

### Current Apex Site Gaps

The current Replit build is clean and modern but too thin (~150 words total). It lacks:
- Social proof (zero reviews, testimonials, or client mentions)
- Trust signals (warranty not prominent, no badges)
- Educational content (no FAQ, no guides)
- Decision tools (no comparison charts, no size guides)
- Visual proof (no gallery, no case studies)

---

## 15. Required Additions (Priority Order)

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Have for Launch

**1. Trust Badges Row** (below hero or above footer)
```
[5-Year Warranty] [IP55 Weatherproof] [UAE-Based Support] [Free Dubai Delivery]

Display as visual badge icons. This is table stakes for conversion.

- "Can I use my existing TV remote?"
- "How long does installation take?"
- "What TV brands are compatible?"
- "What happens if my TV overheats?"
- "Is the enclosure waterproof?"

**4. Comparison Table: Apex vs Outdoor TV**
This visualizes the 70% savings claim - critical for conversion.
```
|                        | Apex + Any TV      | Samsung Terrace 75"  |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Total Cost             | ~AED 14,500       | AED 35,000+         |
| TV Brand Choice        | Any brand         | Samsung only        |
| Upgrade TV Later       | Yes, anytime      | Buy new unit        |
| Enclosure Warranty     | 5 years           | N/A                 |
| Screen Brightness      | Your choice       | Fixed 1500 nits     |
| Smart Features         | Your choice       | Tizen only          |
```

**5. Social Proof Section**
Even without customer reviews yet, we can show:
```
"Engineered for the Gulf"
- Designed in Dubai for Middle East conditions
- Tested to 55°C+ operating temperature
- IP55 certified weatherproofing
- Marine-grade aluminum (won't corrode in humidity)

[Later: Add customer testimonials and install count]
```

### 🟡 IMPORTANT - Significantly Improves Conversion

**6. "How It Works" Visual Steps**
```
Step 1: Choose Your Size (55" to 85")
Step 2: Pick Any TV You Want (Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL - any brand)
Step 3: We Deliver & Install (professional installation available)
Step 4: Enjoy Outdoor Entertainment (protected from heat, dust, rain)
```
Show as 4 icons/illustrations in a horizontal row.

**7. Use Case Gallery/Lifestyle Images**
Show the enclosure in context:
- Villa pool area (primary use case)
- Outdoor majlis/living room
- Garden terrace
- Restaurant/bar setting
- Hotel pool deck

Even AI-generated renders or stock photos with mockups work. Customers need to visualize it in THEIR space.

**8. "Why Not Just Buy an Outdoor TV?" Section**
Address the objection directly:
```
Outdoor TVs like Samsung Terrace cost AED 25,000-45,000.
You're locked to one brand. You can't upgrade without replacing everything.

With Apex, use ANY TV you want. Upgrade anytime.
Same protection, 70% less cost.
```

**9. Size Selection Guide**
```
"Which size is right for you?"

| Viewing Distance | Recommended Size |
|------------------|------------------|
| 2-3 meters       | 55"              |
| 3-4 meters       | 65"              |
| 4-5 meters       | 75" (most popular)|
| 5+ meters        | 85"              |

Not sure? WhatsApp us a photo of your space →
```

**10. Commercial/B2B Path**
Add visible link: "Hotels, Restaurants & Businesses → Bulk Pricing Available"
- Separate inquiry form or just flags the lead as commercial
- Mention: "Multi-unit discounts available"

### 🟢 NICE TO HAVE - Polish & Optimization

**11. Installation Photo or Video**
30-second video or 3-photo sequence showing the install process.
Reduces anxiety about "how complicated is this?"

**12. Guarantee Badge**
```
"30-Day Satisfaction Promise"
Not happy? We'll work with you to make it right.
```

**13. Payment Options**
"Pay in 4 installments with Tabby" (very popular in UAE)
Even if not live yet, shows accessibility for bigger purchases.

**14. Exit-Intent Email Capture**
Popup when leaving: "Get our free guide: 5 Things to Know Before Buying Outdoor TV Protection"
Captures emails from visitors who aren't ready to buy yet.

Captures questions in real-time.
