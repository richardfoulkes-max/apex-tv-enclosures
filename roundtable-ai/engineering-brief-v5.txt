THERMAL DESIGN (v5.0)

AIRFLOW PATH:
1. Ambient air enters via front bottom louvered intake (1650 × 30mm)
2. Passes through MERV 8 filter (standard, tool-less drawer)
3. Internal baffle redirects air to rear of enclosure
4. Air enters 50mm rear plenum (gap between TV back and enclosure back)
5. Air rises across TV heat sinks (PSU, LED driver, main board - all on back)
6. Hot air exits via top exhaust (1650 × 35mm) with 2× 140mm fans

QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

THERMAL:
1. Does 140-160 CFM with 50mm plenum provide adequate margin at 55°C + solar?
2. Is the 13% worst-case margin acceptable, or should we target 20%?
3. Are 2× 140mm fans sufficient, or should we specify 3× 120mm for redundancy?

STRUCTURAL:
4. Does through-bolted VESA with hat-channel stiffeners resolve the load path concern?
5. Is 8mm (4+4) laminated glass adequate for 1.7m span and 10J impact?
6. Does the continuous channel retention resolve point-load and leak path concerns?

SERVICE:
7. Does the hinged service door adequately address field serviceability?
8. Is <20 min fan replacement acceptable, or should we target <15 min?

WEATHER:
9. Is IP54 with the enhanced louver/drain system adequate for outdoor use?
10. Does the segregated wet/dry zone with overflow weirs resolve water ingress risk?

OVERALL:
11. Have all v4.0 blocking issues been resolved?
12. Is this design ready for prototype validation testing?
13. What issues remain that would prevent production release?
