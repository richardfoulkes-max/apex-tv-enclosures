PRODUCT: Apex ATE-75 Outdoor TV Enclosure

WHAT IT IS:
A weatherproof aluminum enclosure ($2,500-$3,500) that lets you install any standard 75" TV outdoors. Features front-breathing thermal management with passive convection and 4 smart fans - no AC unit required. IP55 rated for rain, dust, and humidity.

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES:
- Standard TVs die within weeks outdoors (weather, heat, humidity)
- Purpose-built outdoor TVs cost $25,000-$40,000 for 75"
- Existing enclosures trap heat and kill TVs in summer
- Our solution: $3,500 enclosure + $1,500 TV = $5,000 total (80% savings)

- 6mm tempered glass (anti-glare optional)
- Universal VESA mount fits any 75" TV
- IP55 weather protection

- DIY enclosures: $500-$1,500 (poor thermal = dead TVs)
