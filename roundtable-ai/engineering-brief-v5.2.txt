THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
================================================================================

AIRFLOW ARCHITECTURE: Ducted rear-plenum with forced exhaust

AIR PATH:
1. Filtered intake through bottom bezel (full width)
2. Air passes through MERV 8 filter
3. Internal baffle directs air to rear plenum
4. Air rises through 30mm plenum behind TV back panel
5. Exits via 3× 140mm exhaust fans in top bezel

CRITICAL DESIGN DECISION - 3 FANS vs 2:
- v5.1 had 50mm plenum with 2× 140mm fans (140-160 CFM)
- v5.2 has 30mm plenum with 3× 140mm fans (180-210 CFM)
- Extra fan compensates for increased restriction of narrower plenum
- Higher CFM provides margin for recess installation airflow losses

FAN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Quantity: 3 (all active, no blanking plates)
- Size: 140mm × 140mm × 25mm
- Type: PWM speed control, IP55 rated
- Voltage: 12V DC
- Speed range: 400-1400 RPM
- Airflow per fan: 60-80 CFM
- Static pressure: >2.0 mm H₂O (high-static design)
- Noise at max: <35 dBA per fan
- TOTAL SYSTEM AIRFLOW: 180-210 CFM

THERMAL CALCULATIONS:

Heat Sources:
- TV power consumption: 300W (typical 75" LCD at full brightness)
- Solar gain through glass: 250W
  (800 W/m² × 0.5 m² aperture × 0.6 transmission factor)
- TOTAL HEAT LOAD: 550W (worst case: full sun, 55°C ambient)

Required Airflow (derived):
- Target ΔT: 15°C (ambient 55°C → internal max 70°C)
- Q = ṁ × Cp × ΔT
- ṁ = 550W / (1005 J/kg·K × 15K) = 0.0365 kg/s
- Volume flow = 0.0365 / 1.1 kg/m³ = 0.033 m³/s = 70 CFM minimum
- With 1.5× safety factor: 105 CFM required
- With additional margin for recess restriction: 116+ CFM recommended

v5.2 DELIVERS: 180-210 CFM
MARGIN: 55-80% above minimum requirement

COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
| Version | Depth | Plenum | Fans | CFM | Margin | Verdict |
|---------|-------|--------|------|-----|--------|---------|
| v4.0 | 150mm | 30mm | 2×120mm | 80-100 | Negative | FAILED |
| v5.0 | 180mm | 50mm | 2×140mm | 140-160 | 13% | PASSED |
| v5.1 | 180mm | 50mm | 2+1blank | 140-160 | 13% | PASSED |
| v5.2 | 160mm | 30mm | 3×140mm | 180-210 | 55-80% | REVIEW |

KEY QUESTION: Does the higher fan count adequately compensate for the
reduced plenum depth? v4.0 failed with 30mm plenum + 2×120mm fans.
v5.2 has same 30mm plenum but 3×140mm high-static fans.

================================================================================
RECESS INSTALLATION DESIGN
================================================================================

This is a NEW capability in v5.2. Previous versions recommended wall-mount only.

RECESS CAVITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Width: 1820 mm (enclosure + 30mm gap each side)
- Height: 1100 mm (enclosure + 30mm gap top/bottom)
- Depth: 215 mm minimum

COMPETITOR COMPARISON (Apollo DS7570):
- Enclosure depth: 147mm
- Recess cavity: 1816 × 1099 × 220mm
- Our cavity: 1820 × 1100 × 215mm (MATCHES within 5mm)

RECESS AIRFLOW ANALYSIS:

Intake path:
- Air enters through 30mm bottom gap
- Gap area: 30mm × 1820mm = 54,600 mm² (85 sq in)
- Must turn 90° to enter enclosure bottom bezel

Exhaust path:
- Air exits through 30mm top gap
- Gap area: 30mm × 1820mm = 54,600 mm² (85 sq in)
- Must turn 90° after leaving fan exhaust

Pressure losses in recess:
- Each 90° turn: ~0.3× velocity pressure loss
- Two turns total: ~0.5× system efficiency reduction
- Effective CFM in recess: ~60-70% of free-air rating

RECESS THERMAL ESTIMATE:
- Free-air CFM: 180-210
- Recess efficiency: 60-70%
- Effective recess CFM: 108-147 CFM
- Requirement: 116 CFM
- MARGIN IN RECESS: -7% to +27%

CONCERN: At worst-case (lowest fan speed tolerance + maximum restriction),
recess installation may be marginal. However:
1. User's specific installation is under pergola (shaded = ~350W not 550W)
2. Shaded installation requires only ~60 CFM
3. Even at 60% efficiency: 108 CFM delivered vs 60 CFM required = 80% margin

QUESTION FOR REVIEW: Is the recess capability adequately engineered, or
should we add warnings/restrictions for full-sun recess installations?

================================================================================
DESIGN EVOLUTION CONTEXT
================================================================================

This design has been through multiple iterations based on engineering review:

v3.0 - FAILED (Block Release):
- Front-breathing design with 25mm glass gap
- Problem: Cooled the glass, not the TV heat sinks
- Problem: 4×60mm fans only delivered ~35 CFM
- Problem: IP55 impossible with open front slots

v4.0 - FAILED (Redesign Required):
- Switched to ducted rear plenum (correct strategy)
- Problem: 30mm plenum + 2×120mm fans = only 80-100 CFM
- Problem: No service access without glass removal
- Problem: Insufficient thermal margin at 55°C + solar

v5.0 - PASSED (Prototype Validation):
- Increased depth to 180mm for 50mm plenum
- Upgraded to 2×140mm high-static fans (140-160 CFM)
- Added hinged service door
- Thermal margin: ~13% at worst-case

v5.1 - PASSED (Production De-risk):
- Added 3rd fan position with blanking plate
- Allows field upgrade if thermal issues discovered
- Same 180mm depth, 50mm plenum

v5.2 - CURRENT (Recess-Compatible):
- Reduced depth to 160mm (30mm plenum)
- Activated all 3 fan positions (180-210 CFM)
- Matches competitor recess cavity requirements
- QUESTION: Does higher CFM compensate for narrower plenum?

================================================================================
SPECIFIC REVIEW QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. THERMAL: Is 30mm plenum + 3×140mm fans (180-210 CFM) adequate for
   550W heat load at 55°C ambient? v4.0 failed with 30mm + 2×120mm (80-100 CFM).

2. RECESS: With 60-70% airflow efficiency in recess, is 108-147 effective CFM
   sufficient? Or should full-sun recess installations be restricted?

3. PLENUM FLOW: Will air distribute evenly across the 1680mm wide × 30mm deep
   plenum, or will there be dead zones? Should we add internal baffles?

4. STATIC PRESSURE: Do 140mm fans with >2.0 mm H₂O static pressure overcome
   the restriction of the 30mm plenum adequately?

5. STRUCTURAL: Is 3.0mm 5052-H32 aluminum adequate for 1760mm span with
   ~55kg total load (enclosure + TV)? Any deflection concerns?

6. SERVICE DOOR: Does bottom-hinged 1650×80mm door compromise IP54 rating
   or structural rigidity?

7. CONDENSATION: With 30mm plenum (less air volume than 50mm), is there
   increased condensation risk during temperature cycling?

================================================================================
