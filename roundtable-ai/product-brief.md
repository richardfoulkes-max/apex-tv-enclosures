## The Problem

Businesses want to display content on large screens outdoors (patios, pools, stadiums, retail exteriors, hospitality venues) but face major challenges:

1. **Standard TVs fail outdoors** - humidity, rain, dust, temperature extremes destroy electronics within weeks
2. **Purpose-built outdoor TVs are extremely expensive** - $15,000-$40,000 for 75" outdoor-rated displays
3. **Existing enclosures have thermal problems** - most trap heat, causing TV failure in summer months
4. **Professional installation is complex and costly** - current solutions require HVAC expertise

---

## Our Solution

The Apex ATE-75 is a front-breathing weatherproof enclosure that:

- Accepts any standard 75" commercial TV ($800-$2,000)
- Provides IP55 weather protection (rain, dust, humidity)
- Uses passive + active cooling (no AC unit required)
- Installs with standard VESA mounting
- Total system cost: ~$3,500-$5,000 (enclosure + TV) vs $25,000+ for outdoor-rated alternatives
