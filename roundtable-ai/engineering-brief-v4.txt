| Insufficient airflow | 4× 60mm fans (~35 CFM delivered) | 2× 120mm fans (~80-100 CFM delivered) |
| Enclosure too shallow for ducting | 120mm depth | 150mm depth |
| VESA mount stress | 3mm flat panel | 3mm panel + 5mm reinforcement plate |
| IP55 impossible with open slots | Open rectangular slots | 45° rain louvers + hydrophobic mesh, downgraded to IP54 |
| Cable entry inadequate | Rubber grommets | IP68 cable glands (PG21) |
| No drainage strategy | Weep holes | Side drain channels with drip edges |
| Structural rigidity | Frameless | Corner gussets + formed stiffening ribs |

THERMAL DESIGN (v4.0 DUCTED AIRFLOW)

AIRFLOW PATH:
1. Cool air enters via front bottom louvered intake slot
2. Internal baffle (100mm tall, 45° angle) redirects air to rear
3. Air enters 30mm rear plenum (gap between TV back and enclosure back)
4. Air rises ACROSS TV HEAT SINKS (back and top of TV)
5. Hot air exits via top exhaust slot with 2× 120mm fans

QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

THERMAL:
1. Does the ducted rear plenum (30mm) adequately address the TV back heat sink cooling?
2. Is 80-100 CFM sufficient for 300W heat load with 10-15K delta-T?
3. Are 2× 120mm fans adequate, or should we consider 140mm?
4. Any concerns with the internal baffle creating dead zones?

STRUCTURAL:
5. Does the 5mm VESA reinforcement plate resolve the tear-out concern?
6. Are formed ribs + corner gussets sufficient, or is internal frame still needed?
7. Is 6mm laminated glass adequate at 1.7m span?

WEATHER:
8. Is IP54 achievable with the louvered slot design?
9. Is the wet/dry zone segregation adequate?
10. Any concerns with the drain channel approach?

MANUFACTURABILITY:
11. Is bend + rivet + adhesive approach sound for production?
12. Any issues with the 5052-H32 material choice?

OVERALL:
13. Does this design now pass the critical failure mode tests?
14. What issues remain that would BLOCK release?
15. What additional testing is required to validate?

PREVIOUS VERDICT: BLOCK RELEASE (v3.0)

Issues cited:
- Thermal: FAIL (airflow short 3-8×, path missed hot zones)
- Acoustic: FAIL (60mm fans too loud)
- IP55: FAIL (open slots)
- Structural: FAIL (no reinforcement)

REQUESTED: Re-evaluate v4.0 against same criteria. Pass / Redesign / Block?
