Airflow indication:
- Heat shimmer: Very subtle heat distortion exiting from rear (if possible to render)
- Or alternative: Thin wisps of vapor/steam exiting to show active cooling

Surrounding details:
- Adjacent fan: Second 80mm fan grille visible but slightly soft focus
- Label plate: Product sticker partially visible
- VESA mount: Portion of mounting plate visible in background

Lighting: Key light from upper left, rim light from behind to highlight grille edges
Background: Shallow depth of field fading to neutral gray
Style reference: Computer cooling product photography, Noctua fan marketing
Output: 8K, sharp focus on primary fan, demonstrating thermal engineering quality (~100 CFM total cooling capacity)</div>
